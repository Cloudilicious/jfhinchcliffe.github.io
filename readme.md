## Deliverables

### Design Documentation

1. Demonstrate your understanding of your site's audience

The site's primary audience will (hopefully) be technically minded developers intent on giving me a job. These people would be time-poor, probably browsing on a mobile device, and hyper-critical of any fundamental errors in the page.

2. Demonstrate the design decisions made

I've decided to keep it simple - an introduction page and a project page. As the primary objective is to have the audience contact me, the initial focus of each page has links to my LinkedIn, Twitter and Github.  

The site was designed 'mobile first' - with all styles optimised for viewing on a mobile device. This includes:

* Large font size
* Clear fonts
* Large, clear buttons and links
* Customisation for portrait and landscape view on mobile devices

The desktop design takes advantage of the extra space, and also extends and centers the content within the body and stretches it out to a nice 600px width.

I've opted to avoid Bootstrap or Foundation to get a better grasp of CSS.

3. Demonstrate that you considered usability heuristics

* I've kept things simple / minimal. According to our guest speaker, people won't spend much time on this site, so it's best to keep it sharp.
* Users are informed of their place within the site by setting the top nav bar to "active" and changing the colour to red when they are on the page. The pages also have a heading.
* Styling is kept consistent across all pages - the paragraphs are all similarly coloured / styled, as are the headings and subheadings.

### Presentation

You are to deliver a 5 minute presentation to the class.

The presentation should include:

1. A Walk-through of your design decisions and documents
2. A review of your build process - challenges, favourite parts

Initially I wanted to make a one-page document, but it was about 9 miles long on mobile.
I tried to keep my one-page design alive by using tabs for the content, but after messing around with tabs for a while I realised that maybe I should just put it into multiple pages.

3. A walk-through of your live site and pointing out its  features
4. Answer any questions from students or teachers.
